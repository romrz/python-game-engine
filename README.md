# Python Game Engine

Very basic implementation of a game engine

This is only for fun and for learning purposes.

I created a very basic game engine with physics and collision
detection using a component based system for the game objects.

I created a few demo "games":
- BouncingBalls: Click anywhere on the screen to spawn a new ball
  with a random size, color, velocity and mass. All of this is
  used to respond to the collisions between the balls.

- GravityBalls: Introduces the use of the gravity and acceleration.
  Click anywhere on the screen to spawn a random ball wich will be
  affected by gravity.

- Planets: Introduces the use of forces.
  It shows a black hole at the center of the screen. Click anywhere
  on the screen to spawn a random ball ("planet") which will orbit
  around the blackhole due to the forces applied by it.
